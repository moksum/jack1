          The photograph of the physicists who participated in the 5th Solvay Conference has been 
        described as the most intelligent gathering of people in history.  17 of the 29 individuals
        were recipients of the Nobel Prize, and included such household names as Einstein, Bohr, 
        Curie, Planck, and Heisenberg. So striking was the richness of the company that the photo
        was equated with an anachronistic gathering of Archimedes, Kepler, Newton, and Galileo.
        Often overshadowed by the photo, is the profound impact of the few papers that were actually
        presented.  More on the photo.  a link.
